This site serves as the primary documentation for the Tor Metre tool. The Tor Metre tool is a combination of the Web Page Test framework, with the Tor Browser and a custom Google Cloud orchestration framework. It allows for measurements of the Tor Browser (and tor network) in real world situations. 

In particular, Tor Metre aims to measure browser performance as experienced by the user in realistic browsing situations. Unlike other Tor benchmarking tools (onionperf, Shadow, Chutney), Tor Metre measures the performance of real Tor Browser instances on the live Tor network. It records both network performance data such as round trip times, bandwidth, etc but also visual metrics on webpage loads e.g. time to visual completion, speed index and so on. 

This site is split into four primary sections. 

 1. **Analysis** - Holds both finished reports on previously gathered datasets and reference documentation for supporting scripts. 

 2. **Datasets** - Documents previously gathered datasets and links to download copies

 3. **Tooling** - Howto guides for setting up Tor Metre and references for the various scripts. 

 4. **Exit Latency Project** - Not technically part of Tor Metre proper, this section documents a side project analysing the latency induced by various Tor Exit Relays.
